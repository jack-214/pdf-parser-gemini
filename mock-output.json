  "abstract": "Epistatic interactions, manifested in the effects of mutations on the phenotypes caused by other mutations, may help uncover the functional organization of complex biological networks1-3. Here, we studied system-level epistatic interactions by computing growth phenotypes of all single and double knockouts of 890 metabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the framework of flux balance analysis. A new scale for epistasis identified a distinctive trimodal distribution of these epistatic effects, allowing gene pairs to be classified as buffering, aggravating or noninteracting2,5. We found that the ensuing epistatic interaction network6 could be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact with each other ‘monochromatically' (i.e., with purely aggravating or purely buffering epistatic links). This property extends the concept of epistasis from single genes to functional units and provides a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules. Our approach can be used to infer functional gene modules from purely phenotypic epistasis measurements.",

  "conclusion": "By measuring epistasis with respect to specific positive and negative extremes, we found a distinctive trimodal spectrum, which allowed us to define a network of buffering and aggravating gene interactions. The resulting genetic interaction network identified a special organization of genes into modules that interact with each other through exclusively buffering or exclusively aggravating links. This concept of monochromatic modularity extends the classical gene-gene definition of epistasis to the level of functional units. These results suggest a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interconnections between modules and could complement approaches emphasizing intramodule properties28. It will be interesting to explore what correspondences exist between gene associations identified using different classical and modern conceptual approaches7–12,28–30. In particular, modules defined through monochromatic epistatic interactions may be reflected in gene cotranscription patterns11 or in covariation of module components at other levels30. The trimodal spectrum we predicted computationally, which is also observed in experimental data15, could replace a commonly used hypothesis of identical interactions between all mutations for addressing specific fundamental questions in evolution, such as the possible advantage of sexual reproduction in purging deleterious mutations5,13. Complementing our sensitivity analysis, it would be interesting to study the universality of this trimodal distribution with respect to different assumptions and models, such as different environmental conditions24, objective functions22 and deviation from optimality27. Most notably, future large-scale experimental measurements of epistatic interactions could be designed to test the predicted distribution. Unlike synthetic-lethal screens, characterization of buffering interactions inherently requires much more accurate phenotypic fitness measurements of single and double mutants. Although the FBA model has been valuable in our preliminary exploration of system-level organization of epistasis networks, our current results are specific to computational predictions in deleterious metabolic enzyme knockouts. Quite different patterns might emerge in other types of epistatic interaction, such as those involving beneficial mutations, partial loss of function, regulatory genes or multicellular developmental networks. New types of interactions, such as the compensating interactions discernible in the RNA-virus data set, may motivate the extension of our monochromatic classification approach to networks with more than two colors. Monochromaticity could also be extended to other types of networks in which multiple kinds of mutually exclusive interactions are present, as well as to directed networks, where unidirectional interacting modules could be defined.",

  "introduction": "Metabolism has been studied in its entirety, in a search for hierarchical and modular organization based on topology, reaction fluxes and gene expression. System-level organization of cellular metabolism can alternatively be explored based on the way gene mutations affect each other's phenotypic consequences. The variability spectrum of such epistatic interactions between mutations is attracting attention from the complementary perspectives of evolutionary theory and genetics. From the evolutionary perspective, our understanding of many processes, including speciation, the emergence of sexual reproduction and the maintenance of genetic variability, fundamentally depends on the nature of epistasis. Although the implications of epistasis have been studied mostly under the assumption of identical interactions between all mutations, variability in the level and 'sign' (aggravating or buffering; Table 1) of epistasis between different loci could substantially affect (and sometimes even reverse) its evolutionary consequences. From the genetic perspective, epistatic interactions are of particular importance for elucidating functional association between genes. This premise has motivated recent genome-wide screens for identifying pairs of synthetic-lethal mutations. Such extreme aggravating interactions comprise ~0.5% of the gene pairs tested in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are correlated with functional association between genes. Fundamental questions remain about the distribution of the sign and magnitude of epistatic interactions for the remaining 99.5% of the gene pairs. Despite the immediate importance of these questions from both the evolutionary and the genetic perspectives, available data on the distribution of epistatic interactions are very limited. The most direct experimental measurement, analyzing fitness of double mutants in Escherichia coli, showed that interactions are ubiquitous and that the overall distribution of the level of interactions among random pairs of mutations is unimodal, roughly symmetric and centered near zero epistasis, despite frequent pairwise interactions. This observation is supported by experimental evidence in other organisms and by computational modeling. Environmental factors were also suggested and shown to affect gene interactions.",

  "methods": "FBA. In FBA, mass conservation and additional simplifying assumptions are used to produce quantitative predictions of steady-state rates of metabolic reactions (or fluxes; Vi, i = 1,...,N). FBA has been described in detail elsewhere (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 online for a list of FBA parameters). The two fundamental steps in FBA are (i) the use of linear constraints to define a space I of feasible reaction fluxes for the network and (ii) an optimization step, aimed at finding the set of fluxes in that maximize a given linear objective function, using linear programming. The major set of constraints (mass conservation) can be written as SijV; = 0, where Sij is the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite Mi in reaction j. Our S matrix also incorporates stoichiometric information about all exchange reactions (uptake and secretion) and about the maintenance and growth reactions. The growth reaction, c¡M; biomass, is based on measured organism-specific biomass composition (the ci coefficients). Its flux Vgrowth is the objective function to be maximized. Lower and upper bounds for fluxes (a; ≤ V; b;) are used to impose irreversibility of certain reactions, to define nutrient uptake limitations and to impose the range or value of the maintenance flux. The specific S. cerevisiae stoichiometric model used in this analysis is based on a recently published reconstruction (see URLs and Supplementary Methods online). Our nominal simulated setting consists of a Ahis3 Aleu2 Aripl strain grown on glucose and oxygen-limited minimal medium containing nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, threonine, histidine, leucine and uracil. Sensitivity with respect to the main condition-specific parameters is studied in Supplementary Figure 3 online. Double mutants and epistatic network. Complete deletions of metabolic genes are handled in FBA by setting the corresponding fluxes to zero. Evidence of substantial agreement between experimental data and the FBA predictions for viability of yeast single mutants has been shown (Supplementary Methods online). Fitness for the mutant of gene X is defined as Wx = max{Vgrowth|V ∈ Φ, Vx = 0} / max{Vgrowth|V ∈ Φ}. Like the fitness used in ref. 26, the FBA fitness used here is defined as the mutant growth rate normalized to the wild-type one and is a function of the fluxes of the major carbon utilization pathways. For double mutants, the new constraints are added for both deleted genes. Some caution is required for isoenzymes, as well as in cases where the enzyme is a protein multimer. Also, some genes encode enzymes that catalyze more than one reaction. Such cases are treated by appropriately keeping track of gene-enzyme-flux relationships. We carried out the computations using the commercial software Xpress. A typical run of all the double mutants took ~1 d on a single Pentium 4 processor. After carrying out the FBA double mutant calculations, we calculated the matrix of scaled epistasis ἔxy between gene pairs (X,Y) (X,Y = 1,...,N genes; Table 1). The epistasis network, Ex,y, is then defined as a discretization of the ἔxy values based on two cutoff parameters, θ and 04: Exy = -1 if έχγ < θ; Εxx = 1 if xx > 0+; and Ex,y = 0 otherwise. We used noise cutoff as described in Supplementary Table 1 online. Sensitivity with respect to 0 and 0+ and the noise cutoff parameters is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 online. The Prism algorithm. The algorithm for pairwise reduction into subgraphs monochromatically (Prism) carries out agglomerative clustering, with the additional feature of avoiding, when possible, the generation of clusters that do not interact with each other monochromatically (Supplementary Fig. 6 online). At the onset, each gene is assigned to a distinct cluster. In sequential clustering steps, pairs of clusters are combined until the whole network is covered. At each step, the biological proximity, or affinity Ax,y between cluster x (size nx) and cluster y (size ny), is computed as the linear combination Ax,y = αA_d_x,y + (1 – α)A_a_x,y of a direct affinity A_d_x,y = ∑(X∈x, Y∈y) Ex,x/(nxny) and an associative affinity A_a_x,y = max(X∈x, Y∈y){ax,y} (single linkage), where ax,y = 1 - |∑(z=1 to N) (Ex,z - Ey,z)| / (2N). At every step, each cluster pair (x,y) is also assigned an integer Cx,y, counting how many nonmonochromatic connections would be formed if clusters x and y were joined (i.e., the number of clusters z that have buffering links with x and aggravating links with y, or vice versa). The algorithm hence identifies the set ψ of (x,y) pairs for which Cx,y = Cm, where Cm = min(x,y){Cx,y}. The set ψ contains all the candidate pairs that, if joined at the next step, would cause the minimal possible number of monochromatic conflicts. The pair with highest Ax,y in ψ is then chosen as the pair of clusters to be combined. At a given step, monochromaticity is preserved if Cm = 0. The final clustering solution is assigned a total module-module monochromaticity violation number, Qmodule = ∑ Cm, where the sum is over all the clustering steps. For sensitivity of Prism with respect to choice of parameters α and y, see Supplementary Figure 3 online. Prism carries out a greedy classification, based both on monochromaticity and on the biological relatedness embodied in the affinities. We also implemented a variant, Prism-R, aimed at evaluating the monochromatic clusterability of a network (i.e., how likely it is to find monochromatic solutions in a given network). Prism-R works similarly to Prism, except it ignores the affinities and chooses at random from ψ the pair of clusters to be combined at each step. Multiple runs of Prism-R on a given network may result in different numbers of monochromatic violations, Qmodule. For a given network, the average number of monochromatic violations over an ensemble of Prism-R clustering solutions is defined as Qcluster = <Qmodule>. In the calculations presented, we used an ensemble of 100 Prism-R runs for each network tested. A Matlab implementation of Prism and Prism-R is available on the authors' website (see URLs). Enrichment for annotation similarity between interacting genes. This test assesses the statistical significance of the enrichment of common functional annotation among pairs of interacting (either buffering or aggravating) genes versus what would be expected by chance. Our null hypothesis is that the true enrichment is the one expected if gene interactions were assigned at random. In a one-tailed test, the P value can be computed as the probability of randomly observing a subset of at least k interacting pairs with identical annotation from a set of size n of interacting pairs (with a total of K same-annotation pairs in the full set of N pairs), given by the hypergeometric distribution. The N gene pairs do not include essential genes and gene deletions without phenotypic consequence. For the nominal conditions (Supplementary Methods online), of a total number n = 278 of interacting gene pairs, 21% have identical annotation (i.e., k = 59 pairs), compared with 10% (K = 104) among all N = 1,034 gene pairs. The resulting P value is Pgene ≈ 10−11, which suggests that our null hypothesis is not true. Significance level of monochromatic interactions in the annotation groups. A pair of annotation groups G1 and G2 is defined as violating monochromaticity if there are both buffering and aggravating epistatic links connecting genes in G1 with genes in G2. We define Qgroup as the number of pairs of annotation groups that violate monochromaticity. Having found for the yeast epistatic network that Qgroup = 9 (Fig. 2a), we wanted to know whether this corresponded to an enrichment of monochromatic interactions in a statistically significant way. Our null hypothesis was that Qgroup is what would be expected for a random network. To test this hypothesis, we carried out 10,000 randomizations of the networks, in which the annotation and the topology of gene-gene interactions were conserved but the sign (buffering or aggravating) of each link was randomly assigned (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). The total numbers of buffering and aggravating interactions were fixed. We computed Qgroup for each of these randomized networks and compared the resulting distribution with the observed value (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). None of the 10,000 random networks had fewer mixed links than the real network, corresponding to an upper bound for the P value of Pgroup < 10−4. This is a conservative estimate (Supplementary Fig. 7 online), as quantified by the number of standard deviations (Zgroups = 9.7) separating the observed value (Qgroup = 9) and the average of the distribution (24.5 ± 1.6). Significance level for monochromatic clusterability by Prism. The Prism algorithm, when applied to the epistasis interaction network of yeast metabolism, yields a fully monochromatic solution (i.e., Qmodule = 0). Here we tested the null hypothesis that the true Qmodule is the one expected for a randomized network. We applied the Prism algorithm to 1,000 networks that were randomized as explained above and in Supplementary Figure 7 online. For each network, we calculated the number of monochromatic violations, Qmodule. For the real network we had Qmodule = 0, whereas for all the randomized networks we found Qmodule > 0 (Qmodule = 7.73 ± 1.5; Supplementary Fig. 7 online); hence, Pmodule < 10−3. This result is based on Prism and is algorithm-dependent. A probabilistic test for monochromatic clusterability. We carried out a less biased probabilistic test for monochromatic clusterability (which is not constrained by affinities Ax,y) by calculating Qcluster using Prism-R for each of the 1,000 randomized networks defined above. We tested the null hypothesis that the true Qcluster is the one expected for a randomized network. None of the randomized networks had a lower value of Qcluster than the real network (Pcluster < 10−3). The value of Qcluster in the random networks was 12.9 ± 0.43, compared with 2.73 in the real network (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). We obtained a similar significance level (data not shown) with a different randomization of the network, which allowed for varying topologies while preserving the degree distribution of buffering and aggravating links per node (Supplementary Fig. 7 online).",

  "results": "Here we studied the spectrum of epistatic interactions between metabolic genes in S. cerevisiae using the framework of flux balance analysis (FBA), a mathematical method for computing whole-cell metabolic fluxes and growth rates based on steady-state and optimality assumptions (Supplementary Methods online). Extending previous work on in silico yeast deletion studies, we applied FBA to the complete metabolic network of S. cerevisiae and calculated the maximal rate of biomass production (Vgrowth) of all the networks with single or double gene deletions relative to the rate of biomass production of the unperturbed wild-type network. For the deletion of gene X, fitness was defined as Wx = Vgrowth/Vwild-type (refs. 25–27). For any pair of genes X and Y, we evaluated the level of epistasis by comparing the fitness Wxy of the double mutant with the product of the fitness values Wx and Wy of the corresponding single mutants. We first analyzed the distribution of deviations from this multiplicative behavior using previously proposed scales (Supplementary Fig. 1 online) and concentrated in particular on a conventional nonscaled measure of epistatic interactions: ɛ = Wxy - WxWy (refs. 5,14). In agreement with existing theoretical and experimental results, apart from the synthetic-lethal pairs (located at ɛ < 0), this approach yielded a unimodal distribution of genetic interactions centered around ɛ = 0 (Fig. 1a). Thus, on average, mutations in FBA combined multiplicatively to affect fitness (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). Deviations from no epistasis towards buffering (ɛ > 0) and towards aggravating (ɛ < 0) interactions were equally common (53% and 47%, respectively). On the ɛ < 0 side of the distribution, there seemed to be a distinction between the strongly interacting synthetic-lethal pairs and other, much milder, nonlethal effects. For ɛ > 0, however, such a distinction between strong and weak interactions was not apparent. To assess whether a given value of ɛ was large or small, we used a normalization based on two natural references. For aggravating interactions, the extreme reference case was complete synthetic lethality: Wxy = 0. We compared buffering interactions to the special case in which the mutation with the stronger effect completely buffers the effect of the other mutation: Wxy = min(Wx,Wy) (ref. 20). Using these reference cases, we defined a new scale, ẽ, which quantifies the relative strength of the interactions (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Using the scaled measure of epistasis ẽ, the distribution of the epistasis level diverged into a trimodal distribution (Fig. 1b), which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described. Some experimental support for the predicted trimodal distribution is found in previously published fitness measurements of RNA virus mutants (Fig. le,f). The new scale ẽ uncovered a qualitative distinction between different pairs of genes (Fig. 1c) and allowed them to be classified into three classes: buffering, aggravating and multiplicative. This classification can be represented as a genetic network of buffering and aggravating links between genes. To understand the overall organization of the network, we started with a supervised analysis of the total number of buffering and aggravating interactions between groups of genes defined by preassigned functional annotation. Pairs of epistatically interacting genes were more likely to share the same annotation than would be expected by chance (21% relative to 10% expected for random pairs, Pgene ≈ 10−11; Fig. 2a). Much additional information on functional organization, however, can be extracted by looking for patterns in the remaining 79% of the interacting gene pairs (Fig. 2a). These interactions tend to be either exclusively buffering or exclusively aggravating (Pgroup < 10−4). This property, which we call ‘monochromaticity’ of interactions between gene sets, has a biological interpretation, and we suggest that it is an inherent part of a general definition of functional gene modules. From a system-level perspective, we expect that a disruption in a given functional module (e.g., a mutation affecting the synthesis of a certain amino acid) in the interaction network would either buffer or aggravate the phenotypic consequence of a disruption of a second functional module. Next, we determined whether it was possible to reorganize genes into modules that had no nonmonochromatic exceptions, using an unsupervised method (i.e., without taking into account existing information of gene annotation). Towards this goal, we developed the Prism algorithm, which hierarchically clusters interacting genes into modules that have strictly monochromatic interconnections with each other (Fig. 3). We found that such a classification was achievable for the entire epistasis network of yeast metabolism (Fig. 4) and for a wide range of parameters (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). The probability of Prism achieving such a monochromatic classification in a random network is very small (Pmodule< 10−3). An unbiased random search algorithm suggested that this was a consequence of an inherent mathematical property of the epistasis network, which we call 'monochromatic clusterability' (Fig. 3b,c). The functional modules discerned by the Prism algorithm were largely composed of genes with the same annotation (Fig. 4a). Genes with identical function could be grouped into the same module even in the absence of direct interaction between them (e.g., PROcat and TCA modules; Fig. 4a). One exception was the IDP module, which did not cluster with other TCA cycle genes as expected. This is because the NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase is incapable of participating in TCA cycle-based respiration but does contribute α-ketoglutarate and reduced NADPH for amino acid biosynthesis (Supplementary Note online). Some (63%) of the buffering links also had intrinsic directionality (Fig. 4), which reflects the asymmetric nature of alleviating effects that are not due to trivial buffering in the same linear pathway. The directionality was coherently organized at a high hierarchical level (Fig. 4b), whereas nondirectional buffering links occurred mostly in smaller modules. This emerging pattern was an unanticipated consequence of the Prism approach, rather than an input to it. The modular organization of the epistasis network that we uncovered occurs at multiple levels. The lowest hierarchical level describes how a mutation in a given gene affects the phenotypic consequence of another mutation (Fig. 4a), and the highest level (Fig. 4b) describes how altered functionality of a given module of genes affects the phenotypic consequence of altered functionality of another module. Thus, we derived a system-level description of the network based on the new concept of epistasis between modules rather than between individual genes (Fig. 4b). Most of the recovered modules and their connections are in good agreement with our understanding of yeast metabolism. As expected, perturbations of the respiratory chain or the ATP synthetase would aggravate disruption of glycolysis, because either fermentation or respiratory function is needed for ATP synthesis. Similarly, respiratory chain and ATP synthetase have buffering interactions with each other, because any of these processes is indispensable for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, interactions that were not expected a priori provide interesting predictions of the model, which have not yet been tested in current screens. For example, the simulation predicted a currently unidentified aggravating link between lysine biosynthesis and tryptophan degradation (Supplementary Fig. 4 online).",
